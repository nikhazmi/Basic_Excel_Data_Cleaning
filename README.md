## Cleaning Process (Summary)

### Step 1: Remove Unnecessary Rows
- Deleted blank rows and extra headers to ensure the actual data starts from Row 2.
- Ensured only one row of headers at the top.

###  Step 2: Standardize and Rename Column Headers
- Used the formula:  
  ```excel
  =LOWER(SUBSTITUTE(TRIM(A1), " ", "_"))
  ```
  - `TRIM` removes extra spaces
  - `SUBSTITUTE` replaces spaces with underscores
  - `LOWER` converts to lowercase

- Replaced original headers with these cleaned ones using **Paste Special â†’ Values**.

### Step 3: Remove Duplicates
- Selected the full data table
- Went to `Data` tab â†’ `Remove Duplicates`
- Selected relevant columns (or all) and clicked OK

### Step 4: Format Data Types
- Ensured correct data formats:
  - Dates were formatted as `Short Date`
  - Numbers had 2 decimal places
  - Text columns were aligned and checked for consistency

### Step 5: Clean Data Cells
- Used formulas like:
  - `=TRIM(A2)` â†’ Removes extra spaces in cell values
  - `=CLEAN(A2)` â†’ Removes non-printable characters
- Used **Find & Replace** to correct common issues (e.g. replacing "N/A" with blank)

## Bonus Tips

- Used **Freeze Panes** to lock headers while scrolling.
- Applied **Filters** to columns using `Data â†’ Filter` to explore data inconsistencies.
- Used **Conditional Formatting** to highlight outliers or errors.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel 2023
- Excel formulas: `TRIM`, `SUBSTITUTE`, `LOWER`, `CLEAN`
- Excel built-in tools: Remove Duplicates, Filters, Formatting

## Outcome

- A clean, well-structured Excel file ready for:
  - Reporting
  - Visualization
  - Import into Power BI or SQL
  - Sharing with stakeholders
